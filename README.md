# Quicksort-1---Partition-ALGO

This quickSort function is designed to perform the first partition of the QuickSort algorithm by selecting the first element as the pivot. It rearranges the array so that all elements less than or equal to the pivot come before it and all greater elements come after, then returns the new array without recursively sorting the subarrays.
